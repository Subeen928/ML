List of Image Paths:
Ensure the list image_paths contains the correct paths to the images.

Loading and Checking Image:
cv2.imread(image_path) loads the image. If the image is None, it means the file could not be opened, and a warning is printed.

Convert BGR to RGB:
The image is converted from BGR to RGB format using cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB).

Subplots:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(15, 6)) creates a figure with 2 rows and 5 columns of subplots.

Display Images in Subplots:
Each image is displayed in its respective subplot. Titles are added, and axes are hidden for a cleaner look.

Layout Adjustment:
plt.tight_layout() adjusts the layout to prevent overlap.

Show and Close Plot:
plt.show() displays the plot, and plt.close('all') closes all plots after the window is closed.
